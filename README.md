# fizzbuzz-manual-injection
This project is one of a series that explores a couple of Dependency Injection solutions. It uses the Famous [FizzBuzz Kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz) to demonstrate the different approaches.

This particular project demonstrates how you can use Dependency Injection without any IoC container. J.B. Rainsberger wrote more on this [here](http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/2013/01/29/consequences-of-dependency-inversion-principle/).
